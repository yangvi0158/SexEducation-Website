### Intro
In 2019, we participated in a small exhibition in Taipei where we conveyed our ideas and views about sexual education through multimedia design.

We believe that society should approach sexual education in a rational manner, and there's no need to feel embarrassed or avoid discussing it. To promote this concept, we transformed it into minimal illustrations and animations for public display, aiming to shift society's perspectives and attitudes towards sexual education propagation.

We have divided sexology into three main sections to discuss: sexual organs, sexual related phenomena, and sexual intercourse.
